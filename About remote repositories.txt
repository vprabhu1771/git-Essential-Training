GitHub's collaborative approach to development depends on 

publishing commits from your local repository to GitHub for other 

people to view, fetch, and update.


About remote repositories

A remote URL is Git's fancy way of saying "the place where your code is stored." 

That URL could be your repository on GitHub, or another user's fork, or even on a completely different server.


You can only push to two types of URL addresses:

An HTTPS URL like https://github.com/user/repo.git

An SSH URL, like git@github.com:user/repo.git

Git associates a remote URL with a name, and your default remote is usually called origin.




Creating remote repositories

You can use the git remote add command to match a remote URL with a name. 

For example, you'd type the following in the command line:

git remote add origin  <REMOTE_URL> 

This associates the name origin with the REMOTE_URL.

You can use the command git remote set-url to change a remote's URL.




Choosing a URL for your remote repository

There are several ways to clone repositories available on GitHub.

When you view a repository while signed in to your account, 

the URLs you can use to clone the project onto your computer are available 

below the repository details.

For information on setting or changing your remote URL, see "Managing remote repositories."
